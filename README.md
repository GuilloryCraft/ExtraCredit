## Installation

Assuming you've already setup [Steamodded **1.0.0-Alpha**](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), simply download the repository here as a Zip file using the 'Code' button above and then unzip the entire archive into it's own folder at '%appdata%\Balatro\mods', then restart the game.

*Note:* You will need to start a new run to use the new jokers, attempting to continue a previous run in progress will likely crash the game.
